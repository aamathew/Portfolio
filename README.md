# Portfolio
Project 1: Working on my portfolio
The goal of this project was to use my skills to create a portfolio website to achieve these tasks :

1. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.
2. Hosted on Netlify or Github Pages.
3. Commits to Github every day.
4. A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

The Process:
1. Started with the html. Html deals with the overall layout of the page and is essentially the structure of the website. This includes adding content to the website such as images.
2. After the layout and desired content are on the page, used css in order to style the page for my desired look. 
3. Used Javascript and jquery to make the website interactive.
